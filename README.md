# MassBeacon

**MassBeacon** is a RuneLite plugin designed to help players find active worlds for otherwise “dead content” — minigames and activities that often lack players. By broadcasting and collecting real-time data from users, MassBeacon provides a simple way to see where the action is happening.

## Overview

Many Old School RuneScape activities suffer from low player participation — Barbarian Assault, Corporeal Beast, and others can be tough to find teams for.  
MassBeacon aims to fix that by creating a lightweight “activity beacon” system powered by a shared backend. Players using the plugin can see which worlds currently have other players doing the same activity, helping groups form organically.

---

## How It Works

- When a player enters a supported activity area, the plugin **pings** the MassBeacon backend.
- The backend aggregates activity data and serves it to all clients.
- Other players can see which worlds currently have active participants for that content.

Example:
> You open the Barbarian Assault lobby and instantly see which worlds already have players — no more hopping through empty worlds.
